# SalesmanProblem_GA
A student project realize a visualization of the traveling salesman problem with the use of genetic algoritm.

# Application example

# Introducing
## project assumptions
The aim of the project is to solve the traveling salesman problem with the use evolution algorithms. In this project, we used a genetic algorithm. Visualization of the problem, added possibilities a changes a parametrs. Comparison of the genetic algorithm with the traditional symetric algorithm of the traveling salesman problem.

## Technologies
- .NET core 3.1
- C#
- WPF

# Theory
 **Evolutionary algorithm** - it is an algorithm inspired by biological activities. Algorithm used to patterns of operation modeled on the theory of natural selection and evolution. Evolutionary algorithms are mainly used for optimization problems. With the help of this algorithm, our solution changes over time, more and more adapting to the given recommendations, thanks to which our solution evolves and becomes better and better.

### Genetic Algorithm
**Genetic algorithm** - is a family of algorithms looking for the best solution to a problem based on the phenomenon of genetic evolution. The image of a given problem is also built on the bases of biology. 





# Setup

# Inspiration 
The algorithm was based on an existing design: http://www.theprojectspot.com/tutorial-post/applying-a-genetic-algorithm-to-the-travelling-salesman-problem/5 made in Java. We introduced a small changes on algorithm, to convert it to C# code. We added new functionalities. We mainly focused to a visualization a problem, for example we have added a path to a map, showing the best tour (which cities should be visited in a generation). Added possibility to observe how the algorithm is doing by changing its parametrs.
